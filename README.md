## Commands

### Development

```
yarn install
```

Log in to the devhub org and give it the og alias

```
sfdx auth:web:login -a og
```

Create a scratch org and give it alias og-scratch

```
sfdx force:org:create edition=Developer -s -a og-scratch -v og
```

Push code to scratch org

```
sfdx force:source:push -u og-scratch
```

Open the scratch org in a browser

```
sfdx force:org:open -u og-scratch
```

Pull code changes from the scratch org

```
sfdx force:source:push -u og-scratch
```

To test your changes locally, change the url in the namedCredential to the `WEBHOOK_URL` you use for oneserve. But **BE VERY CAREFUL** not to push that change in the production package. TODO(dww) Can I write a test that the named credential is oneserve.onegraph.com

### Testing and Linting

PMD scanner in vscode:
[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chuckjonas.apex-pmd](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chuckjonas.apex-pmd)

sfdx-scanner cli tool:

```
sfdx plugins:install @salesforce/sfdx-scanner
sfdx scanner:run --target package/
```

### Adding a new SObject

Requirements:
  1. The SObject must be available in a default organization
     a. The `expansions` directory allows us to create expansion packages that adding custom SObjects
  2. Run `yarn create-toggle-custom-setting-fields`
  3. Update `SalesforceSubscriptionHelpers.supportsTriggerToggle` in the oneserve codebase
  4. Update the postinstall script to disable the toggles during an upgrade

### Create new beta package

**be sure this will work, because we can only do it 5 times a day\***

You can run `force:package:version:create` with `--skipvalidation` to test more variations, but make sure the package you release wasn't created that way.

First, update versions in `sfdx-project.json` and OneGraphPackageVersion:

- Set version num to be larger than the last, e.g. 0.2.0.0
- Set ancestorVersion to be the last released package version or people won't be able to upgrade
- Update versionName
- Update version and versionString in the OneGraphPackageVersion (sorry that this isn't automatic)

Test that it will build
```
sfdx force:package:version:create --package "OneGraph GraphQL Subscriptions" --skipvalidation --installationkeybypass -v og --postinstallscript PostInstallScript --uninstallscript UninstallPackage
```

Create a beta version
```
sfdx force:package:version:create --package "OneGraph GraphQL Subscriptions" --codecoverage --installationkeybypass -v og --postinstallscript PostInstallScript --uninstallscript UninstallPackage
```
Install it in a salesforce org and make sure it works.
